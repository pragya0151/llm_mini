# Professional RAG Chat (Tiny LLaMA + FAISS)

<img width="1876" height="918" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b1a6ac-8ee7-4924-8627-e6172611feef" />



Professional RAG Chat is a web application that allows users to ask questions on uploaded PDFs using a lightweight Tiny LLaMA model combined with a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval. It can also answer general knowledge queries even without uploaded files and highlights relevant sections in PDFs for easy reference.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Upload & Processing**  
   Users can upload one or more PDFs. Each PDF is automatically chunked into smaller segments, indexed, and stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.

2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
   Questions are processed using a Tiny LLaMA model combined with the FAISS database. The system retrieves relevant chunks from PDFs and generates context-aware answers.

3. **General Knowledge Queries**  
   If no PDFs are uploaded, the Tiny LLaMA model alone answers questions using its internal knowledge.

4. **Highlighting Sources**  
   Relevant snippets from uploaded PDFs are highlighted and displayed along with the answer.

5. **Explain Like I’m 5**  
   Optional mode simplifies answers for easier understanding.

6. **FAQ Sidebar**  
   A dedicated sidebar contains frequently asked questions about RAG, uploading PDFs, Tiny LLaMA functionality, and general   AI usage tips.

7. **Past Questions Section**  
   All previous user questions and their corresponding answers are stored in an expandable format, allowing users to quickly review past interactions. A “Clear History” button resets the chat session.

## What We Are Coding

This project combines **frontend UI**, **backend API**, and **AI processing** to create an interactive question-answering system:

1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**  
   - Input box for user queries and "Explain Like I’m 5" checkbox.  
   - PDF upload section with "Process Files" button.  
   - Displays answers in a styled card format and shows highlighted PDF chunks.  
   - Sidebar contains FAQ and past question history.  

2. **Backend (FastAPI)**  
   - Accepts uploaded PDFs and stores them in a local folder.  
   - Chunks PDFs into smaller text segments for efficient retrieval.  
   - Builds a FAISS vector database to enable fast semantic search.  
   - Handles user queries:  
     - **With PDFs:** Queries the FAISS vector database to find relevant chunks and uses Tiny LLaMA to generate context-aware answers.  
     - **Without PDFs:** Uses only Tiny LLaMA to answer general questions.  
   - Generates highlighted PDF snippets for the frontend display.  
   - Provides endpoints for uploading files, querying answers, clearing uploads, and downloading highlighted PDFs.

3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Logic**  
   - Uses FAISS to retrieve semantically relevant chunks from PDFs.  
   - Feeds retrieved chunks into the Tiny LLaMA model for coherent answer generation.  
   - Optional “Explain Like I’m 5” mode simplifies the output.  

4. **State Management**  
   - Keeps track of past user queries and assistant answers in Streamlit’s session state.  
   - Sidebar shows expandable past questions with corresponding answers for easy review.
